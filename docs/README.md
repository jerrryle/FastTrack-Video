## Feature Overview

FastTrack video allows long-distance patient and VTOC Care Team contact through virtual visits.<br>
Max of 2 participants - VTOC Care Team Member + Patient  (Initial Release - future versions will allow for additional participants)

## Set Up
 This feature is a company setting in Admin Suite which can be enabled by VisionTree. Patient verification settings depend on the company FastTrack settings.
## Requirements
* Device with a modern web browser ( Phone, Tablet or Desktop Computer)

* Microphone

* Camera

Participants must have an up-to-date browser. It is encouraged that they provide access to the device microphone and camera, although it is possible to enter the meeting without. The patient **must have a date of birth and consent to email communications in order to receive a FastTrack video email**.

### Supported Browsers

FastTrack Video requires recent versions of Chrome and Firefox, and Safari 11 or greater.

## CareTeam Experience
To start a virtual visit, the user will navigate to the patient's profile, click **'Perform Actions'** then select **'Start Virtual Visit Using FastTrack Video'**. If the visit was launched recently, the link will 
say **'Join Existing Virtual Visit Using FastTrack Video'** along with a timestamp of last launch.

A pre launch page will load, letting the user know an email was sent to the patient. This notification includes a **‘Copy Patient’s FastTrack Video Link’**, which can be used if the user should send the link some other way. From here, the user accepts this prompt and proceeds to the virtual visit waiting room.

Before the visit, participants will be asked for permission to access the device's microphone and camera. The virtual visit waiting room will load, and the software will prepare use of the microphone and camera. The user can choose to mute the microphone or turn off the camera prior to and during the visit.

## Patient Experience

Once the care team user initiates the Virtual Visit, the patient receives an email containing the visit link.

Upon clicking the link, a patient verification page will load. Requirements will depend on the company's FastTrack configuration.

Before the visit, the patient will be prompted for access to their device. They too can adjust settings and choose to expand the view. During the visit, the patient can mute/unmute the microphone, turn on/off the camera, and share their screen.
